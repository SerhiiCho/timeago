## ⚙️ Configurations

#### Language

Default language is English. Optionally you can set the language in your application by calling `timeago.Set()` function and pass the flag "ru" or "en" in your init function.

```go
func init() {
    timeago.Set("language", "ru")
}
```

##### Location

Default location is Europe/Kiev. Optionally you can set the location in your application by calling `timeago.Set()` function and pass the location you need in your init function.

```go
func init() {
    timeago.Set("location", "America/New_York")
}
```

> Please make sure that timezone configuration is correct for your location. It is very important for displaying the correct datetime.

## 👏 Usage

For outputting post publishing date or something else you can just pass the date to method `timeago.Take()`. It will count the interval between now and given date and returns converted format.

```go
timeago.Take("2019-10-23 10:46:00") // after 10 seconds outputs: 10 seconds ago
```

If you want to show last user login like if user is online or not, you can optionally add `|online` to the datetime string. All it does is just displaying **Online** if date interval withing 60 seconds.

```go
timeago.Take("2019-10-23 10:46:00|online")
```

## 🇸🇿 Contribute translation

If you want to contribute support for a language that is fully supported, all you need to do is to copy/paste 2 files and change them to match the language that you want to add.

After than, add 1 line to `README.md` file and 1 rule to a `rules.go`. Here is my [commit](https://github.com/SerhiiCho/timeago/commit/d2f9e7f41d17ea3fc8ee10df2e1ac2e47f8e7e69) for supporting Ukrainian language that shows changes that I did to add the support. It's pretty straightforward. Waiting for you PR 😉.

### Translation files

Translation files live in `langs` directory. Each translation file is pretty simple json. Here's the example of `en.json`.

```json
{
    "Ago": "ago",
    "Online": "Online",
    "Second": "second",
    "Seconds": "seconds",
    "Minute": "minute",
    "Minutes": "minutes",
    "Hour": "hour",
    "Hours": "hours",
    "Day": "day",
    "Days": "days",
    "Week": "week",
    "Weeks": "weeks",
    "Month": "month",
    "Months": "months",
    "Year": "year",
    "Years": "years"
}
```

Some languages (like Russian) have multiple plural forms of the word. For example English has only `second` and `seconds`, but Russian language has 3 types `секунда`, `секунд` and `секунды`. For these cases we can add additional translation for seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months and years. Here is the example of `ru.json`.

```json
{
    "Ago": "назад",
    "Online": "В сети",
    "Second": "секунда",
    "Seconds": "секунды",
    "SecondsSpecial": "секунд",
    "Minute": "минута",
    "Minutes": "минуты",
    "MinutesSpecial": "минут",
    "Hour": "час",
    "Hours": "часа",
    "HoursSpecial": "часов",
    "Day": "день",
    "Days": "дня",
    "DaysSpecial": "дней",
    "Week": "неделя",
    "Weeks": "недели",
    "WeeksSpecial": "недель",
    "Month": "месяц",
    "Months": "месяца",
    "MonthsSpecial": "месяцев",
    "Year": "год",
    "Years": "года",
    "YearsSpecial": "лет"
}
```

You can see that it has `SecondsSpecial`, `MinutesSpecial`, `HoursSpecial`, `DaysSpecial`, `WeeksSpecial` and `YearsSpecial` keys.

### Rules

All rules for each language is defined in `getRules` function in `rules.go` file. Rule is just a set of conditions that define when to apply singular form and when to apply plural form.

Here is the example for English rules:

```go
func getRules(number, lastDigit int) map[string]models.Rule {
	return map[string]models.Rule{
		"en": {
			Single: number == 1,
			Plural: number > 1 || number == 0,
		},
	}
}
```

We'll use singular form when number is equal to 1, and plural if number is more than 1 or number is 0. You can easily write your own rules for your language.
